  We decided to create a device with a series of sensors with the purpose of allowing users to measure and store information about the 
environment in high littering areas for research purposes. Our hardware gathers Temperature, Humidity and Air Quality using sensors and then 
displays it on a screen for the user and sends it to a database in order to be studied, which will also update the information in our app. 
This will allow the users to take proper measures before working on an area that might have for example high levels of CO2 which is harmful 
in dense quantities.
	As soon as a user enters an area with high levels of littering displayed on the applicationâ€™s map the device would start running, 
gathering Temperature, Humidity, Carbon Dioxide and Volatile Organic Compounds data and storing it in a database. This data will then be 
displayed in an LCD screen attached to the device for the user to read it and allow him to take the necessary safety precautions before working 
on that zone for extended periods of time. Since the data is stored in the database, it will also be displayed in our Android app to allow every
other user to know the readings of said area.
	In conclusion, our device grants users a safe, easy to use option to care of their health as they help clean up the environment.
